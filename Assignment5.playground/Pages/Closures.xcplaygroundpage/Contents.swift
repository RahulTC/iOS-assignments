// Closure
//Closure is an unnamed block of code, that we can pass around and use in code and can assigne to a variable or can return from a function also.
// Closures are reference type like classes
// They capture and store the reference to any constants and variable surrounding context
// Closures are non-escaping closure

// Types of Closure
// 1. Non-escaping Closure
// 2. Escaping Closure
// 3. Trailing Closure
// 4. Auto Closure

// MARK: Escaping Closure
/// For using escaping closures we use the anotation "@escaping"
/// Escaping closures are used to outlive the lifespan of the function.

// MARK: Trailing Closure
/// Whenever there is a closure which is last parameter for a function then it will be called as a trailing closure.
/// We take three parameters and onSuccess is a closure as the last parameter

// MARK: Auto Closure
/// When a closure doesn't take any parameter and does not return anything from closure then it gets self wrapped when called is known as Auto Closure
